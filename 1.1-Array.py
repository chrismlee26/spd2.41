# 1 Given an array of 'n' nubers and a target value 't', find two numbers whose sum is 't':
# Example: a=[5, 3, 6, 8, 2, 4, 7], t=10 => [3, 7] or [6, 4] or [8, 2]

# 2 Two Sum II - Input Array is sorted
# Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that are already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length

# 3 Given an array 'a' of 'n' numbers and a count 'k', find the 'k' largest values in the array 'a'.
# Example: a=[5, 1, 3, 6, 8, 2, 4, 7], k=3  â‡’  [6, 8, 7]

# 4 Given two arrays 'a' and 'b' of numbers and a target value 't', find a number from each array whose sum is closest to 't'.
# Example: a=[9, 13, 1, 8, 12, 4, 0, 5],  b=[3, 17, 4, 14, 6],  t=20  â‡’  [13, 6] or [4, 17] or [5, 14]
