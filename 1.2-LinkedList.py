# 1 Given a single-linked list, find the middle value in the list.
# Example

# 2 Given a singly-linked list, reverse the order of the list by modifying the nodesâ€™ links.

# 3 Given a singly-linked list, rearrange the nodes by interleaving the first half of the linked list with the second half.

# 4 Rotate a given singly-linked list counter-clockwise by k nodes, where k is a given integer.

# 5 Given an array of k singly-linked lists, each of whose values are in sorted order, combine all nodes (do not create new nodes) into one singly-linked list with all values in order.

# 6 Given a singly-linked list, find whether or not it contains a cycle, and if it does, find the node at which the cycle starts (the node that two other nodes reference/point to).

# 7 Given a singly-linked list and an integer k, find the value in the kth-to-last node.
