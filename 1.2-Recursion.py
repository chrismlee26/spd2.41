# 1 Given a sorted array of strings, write a recursive function to find the index of the first and last occurrence of a target string. If the target string is not found in the array, report that.
# Example input:  instructors = [Adriana, Adriana, Alan, Alan, Alan, Alan, Alan, Braus, Braus, Braus, Braus, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dani, Dani, Jess, Meredith, Milad, Milad, Mitchell, Mitchell, Mitchell, Mitchell]
# Example execution:  find_indexes(instructors, 'Braus')  ⇒  (7, 10)

# 2 Given a string of digits 2 to 9 a user has pressed on a T9 “old school” telephone keypad, return a list of all letter combinations they could have been trying to type on the keypad.
# Example execution 1:  t9_letters("23")  ⇒  ["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"])
# Example execution 2:  t9_letters("4663")  ⇒  ["gmmd", …, "gone", …, "good", …, "home", …, "hood", …, "ioof"]
