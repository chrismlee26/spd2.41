# Challenging problems we’ve seen before:
# Given an array of k singly-linked lists, each of whose values are in sorted order, combine all nodes (do not create new nodes) into one singly-linked list with all values in order.
# Given a binary search tree, convert it into a sorted doubly-linked list by modifying the original tree nodes (do not create new nodes).
# Let’s say a binary tree is "super balanced" if the difference between the depths of any two leaf nodes is at most one. Write a function to check if a binary tree is "super balanced".
